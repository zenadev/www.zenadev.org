We aim to be the go-to community for professionals in the software industry living around the Genova local area.


### Get involved

We use [Meetup][meetup] and the [#zenadev][channel] channel on the [GrUSP Slack][slack] as our media of communication. 

Everybody is welcome and we always look for speakers, expecially first timers!


### Code of Conduct

To ensure a healthy and welcoming environment, every participant to the activities of the group should abide by the rules of our [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md), which basically boils down to being respectful and decent.


### Contacts

Please reach out to [zenadev@grusp.org][mail] if you need to get in touch with any of the organizers.


### Recognition

We are sponsored by [GrUSP][grusp], one of the biggest Italian associations of software developers.
