# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
the ZenaDev user group organizers and members pledge to making participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

ZenaDev organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

ZenaDev organizers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other interactions 
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to interdict to any participant,
temporarily or permanently, access to any user group activity for other behaviors 
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within ZenaDev spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the user group. Examples of
representing ZenaDev include using an official project e-mail address, posting 
via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the user group 
may be further defined and clarified by the organizers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the ZenaDev organizers at [zenadev@grusp.org][mail]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The organizers are
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

User group organizers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the user group's leadership.
